**vscode** is one of the best text editors out there, great for writing, testing and running code and projects

vscode has an outstanding extention for write markdown (a simplified way of writing html). You need markdown to write documentation for you Mendix plugin widgets. The extention can be found here [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)

A great markdown cheatsheet can be found [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet):
